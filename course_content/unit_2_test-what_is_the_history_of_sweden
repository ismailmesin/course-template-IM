1. In the context of concurrent programming in Go, which of the following is NOT a characteristic of goroutines?

    A) They are managed by the Go runtime
    - Correct. Goroutines are indeed managed by the Go runtime.
  
    B) They require explicit setup for thread-safe execution
    - Incorrect. One of the major features of goroutines is that they are designed to safely run concurrently without requiring explicit setup for thread safety.
    
    C) They offer an easy way to achieve parallelism
    - Incorrect. Goroutines are indeed an easy way to accomplish parallel tasks execution in Go.

2. Which of the following statements about the Go code snippet is true?
```Go
goroutine func() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Golang")
} ()
```

    A) It creates a goroutine that prints "Hello, Golang" to the standard output, but we can't guarantee it will be executed before the main program exits
    - Correct. This code creates a new goroutine for printing, but since goroutines run concurrently with the main function, we are not guaranteed it will be executed before the main program exits.
  
    B) It will certainly print "Hello, Golang"
    - Incorrect. Although this code does create a new goroutine that should print "Hello, Golang," there's no guarantee the goroutine will be executed before the main program exits.
  
    C) It will cause a compile-time error
    - Incorrect. This code is syntactically correct, and it will not cause a compile-time error. However, the goroutine might not run at all if the main function completes before the goroutine gets the chance to run.
