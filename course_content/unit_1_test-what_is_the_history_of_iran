1. In parallel programming, what does the division of a program into smaller tasks to be executed simultaneously represent?

    A) Multithreading
    - Incorrect. Multithreading is a form of concurrent execution, but it doesn't comprise the entirety of what parallel execution is about. 

    B) Multiprocessing
    - Correct. Multiprocessing describes the action of multiple tasks being executed simultaneously across multiple processors.

    C) Sequential Processing
    - Incorrect. Sequential processing implies tasks being performed one after the other, and not simultaneously.

2. Below is a snippet of Go code. What keyword in Go is used to spawn a new Goroutine in this code?

```go
func say(s string) {
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
        fmt.Println(s)
    }
}

func main() {
    go say("world")
    say("hello")
}
```

   A) `new`
   - Incorrect. Apart from the fact that the `new` keyword in Go is used for memory allocation, it also doesn't appear in the code snippet.

   B) `func`
   - Incorrect. The `func` keyword is used to define new functions in Go, but it's not this keyword that spawns a new Goroutine in the provided code.

   C) `go`
   - Correct. The `go` keyword in Go precedes the function call, `say("world")`, to create a new Goroutine.
