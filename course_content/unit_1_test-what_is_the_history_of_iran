1. Which package in Go provides basic synchronization primitives in Go?

    A) `fmt` package
    - Incorrect. The `fmt` package is primarily used for formatting strings for console output. It doesn't provide any synchronization primitives.
  
    B) `net` package
    - Incorrect. The `net` package provides a portable interface for network I/O, including TCP/IP, UDP, domain name resolution, and Unix domain sockets. It does not provide synchronization primitives.

    C) `sync` package
    - Correct. `sync` package provides basic synchronization primitives such as WaitGroups, Mutexes and Cond. It doesn't provide any I/O functionality.


2. How do you start a function execution in a new goroutine in Go language?

    A) Wrap the function in `func()`
    - Incorrect. Wrapping the function inside `func()` just defines a new anonymous function. It does not start the function execution in a new goroutine.
  
    B) Prepend `go` keyword before the function call
    - Correct. Prepending `go` before a function call starts the function's execution in a new goroutine.

    C) Call `new(func())`
    - Incorrect. `new(func())` would try to initialize a new instance of a function, which is not a correct syntax in Go.


3. What happens when you send data on an unbuffered channel in Go?

    A) It blocks the sender goroutine until the data is received by another goroutine from the channel.
    - Correct. When you send data using an unbuffered channel, it blocks the sending goroutine until another goroutine receives the data from the channel.

    B) It blocks the sender goroutine indefinitely until manually unblocked.
    - Incorrect. It doesn't block indefinitely. It only blocks until the data is received from the channel by another goroutine or the channel is closed.

    C) The data is sent immediately without blocking the sender goroutine.
    - Incorrect. In an unbuffered channel, the sender goroutine is blocked until the data is received from the channel by another goroutine.
